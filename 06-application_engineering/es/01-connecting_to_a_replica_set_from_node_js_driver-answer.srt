1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
All right, the answer is the
missing node will be

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,140
discovered, as long as you list
at least one valid node.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,020
So the driver will actually
automatically detect that the

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,280
node you listed is a Replica Set
member and then detect all

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,420
the other ones, and
connect to those.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,340
But remember that if you have
a Replica Set, and that node

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,530
happens to be down, you may
have an actual primary and

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,150
actual secondary, you may have
the majority of the nodes up,

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,540
but you won't be able to connect
just because you

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,880
haven't given any nodes that
happen to be up at the time.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,080
So it's probably best to add all
the members, but it will

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,650
automatically discover them, if
you happen to accidentally

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,380
leave some out.
