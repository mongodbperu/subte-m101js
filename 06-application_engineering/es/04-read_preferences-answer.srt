1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,400
All right, so the answer to the
quiz is these first three.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,010
So this one and this one are
basically saying that reading

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,810
from the secondary, adds more
load to the secondary.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,640
And you have to be aware of the
consequences that may have

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,460
to your entire system.

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,460
If your secondary becomes
overloaded, it may lag behind

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,520
the primary, because it can't
actually keep up and replicate

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,670
the data while also servicing
other reads.

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,740
Another issue is you may not
read what you just wrote,

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,790
because the secondary may not
have the time to catch up.

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,940
And then last one, which is
similar to the first answer,

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,390
is just that it may slow down
the secondary, if the

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,480
secondary isn't powerful
enough to keep up

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,730
with all the reads.

16
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,600
