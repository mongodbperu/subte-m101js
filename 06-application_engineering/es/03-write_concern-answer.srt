1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,720
All right so the answer is--

3
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,200
The write weights forever.

4
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,770
Now this may not be true if
you have a timeout, but

5
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,910
basically, the driver
keeps waiting for a

6
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,610
response from the nodes.

7
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,930
Doesn't throw an error and the
server doesn't throw an error.

8
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,690
It's just waiting to meet the
requirements that you set in

9
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,129
the write concern.

10
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,580
It does not go to as many nodes
as possible then return

11
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,120
success because that would not
be meeting the constraints

12
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,520
that we specified.

13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,070
It would be writing to fewer
nodes than we specified in the

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,560
write concern, which means that
we would be getting the

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,070
wrong idea about where
our data actually is.

16
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,380
So that's the answer to the quiz
about node concern and

17
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,630
the node.js driver.

18
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,470
