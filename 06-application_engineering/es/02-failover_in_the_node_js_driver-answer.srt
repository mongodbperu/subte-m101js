1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,340

2
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,110
So the answer to this quiz is
the insert will be buffered

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,830
until the election completes.

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,220
Then the callback will be called
after the operation to

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,650
sent and a response
is received.

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,590
So basically, this insert will
just take longer than you

7
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,340
might expect, but the callback
will be called normally, once

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,510
the driver is able
to successfully

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,230
complete the operation.

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,620
So basically, the driver will
buffer this for you until it

11
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,440
can successfully complete the
operation and then call the

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,920
callback with the result,
as it normally would.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,170
