1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,050

2
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,900
So now let's talk about
homework number

3
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,820
two for week three.

4
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,430
So for this homework we'll be
revisiting the blog project

5
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,140
and actually add the ability
to make new posts.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,150
So you actually should have
already added the ability to

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,840
Login and Logout and to make
a new user, but if not--

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,680
if you had some issues with
that, we're actually going to

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,820
give you a new stencil that has
those sections included so

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,330
you can go check your work on
the parts that you filled in

11
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,760
last week and the parts that
you already filled in.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,240
So for this homework we're
actually going to be adding

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,150
the ability to make new posts.

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,070
So right now we're logged in as
the user test, so let's go

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,330
up here and click on New Post.

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,460
All right, so far so good.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,635
We're on the new post page.

18
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:48,220
Let's make a title of new post
and entry of entry and let's

19
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,400
just go down here and let's
submit this form.

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,930
All right, so here we get an
error insertEntry NYI, so that

21
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,070
gives us a hint as to what
we're actually missing.

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,620
So it's actually the
post request.

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,599
When we try to make a new post
we need this insert entry

24
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,470
function to actually
insert the post

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,330
entry into our database.

26
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,590
So let's take a look at
the code for that.

27
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,620
So down here we have this stack
trace because we're

28
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,690
missing the insertEntry function
so let's stop this.

29
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,650
So the way you can find out what
you need to implement for

30
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,330
this project is you can just run
this command and you get

31
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,400
back posts.js line 32,
homework 3.2 TODO.

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,530
So let's open posts.js.

33
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,210
So we look at this file and we
can see this is the posts data

34
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,990
access object and one of the
things we do here is we say

35
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,200
var posts equals
db.collection.posts.

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,770
So you can actually use this to
perform operations against

37
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,670
the post collection so you don't
actually have to use

38
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,910
this db object directly.

39
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,550
So if we go down here--

40
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,270
the getPosts function-- we can
see an example of using it.

41
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,450
We're using posts.find.sort and
giving it some arguments.

42
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,180
And this is just an example of
using this posts object.

43
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,760
It's equivalent to doing
db.collection posts.find.

44
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,520
Just wanted to show
how you use that.

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,509
All right, so let's take a
look at what we have to

46
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,120
implement for homework 3.2.

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,020
So if we look up here
we can see we have

48
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,200
this insertEntry function.

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,490
So a lot of this is
done for you.

50
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,650
We're making this post, we have
the permalink, and we've

51
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,620
built this entire post object--
this is complete.

52
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,130
Now all you have to do is figure
out how to insert it

53
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,850
into the posts collection.

54
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,530
So down here we see our call
back with the error message

55
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,810
that we saw when we tried to
open this page and tried to do

56
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,860
this operation when we were in
the browser and the stack

57
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,630
trace we saw in the shell.

58
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,120
So just to take a look at
surrounding code, this is the

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,140
insertEntry function and
basically takes title, body,

60
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,150
tags, author, callback.

61
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,670
And actually all the code to
build this post and actually

62
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,430
create this post object
is all done for you.

63
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,180
All the processing, all the
sanitizing input is done for

64
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,460
you, so all you really need to
do is figure out how to insert

65
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,410
this post into the
posts collection.

66
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,620
So this will actually give us
support for creating a new

67
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,270
post and this is your assignment
for homework 3.2.
