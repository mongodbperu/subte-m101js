1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,110

2
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,550
All right, so this is the
solution for Homework 3.3, and

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,240
our goal was to add a
comment to a post.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,130
So if you remember,
the post actually

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,830
has an array of comments.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,120
So the way we add a comment to
the post is we actually have

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,650
to push it on the end
of the array.

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,010
So for this we use an update.

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,120
And this is actually an in-place
update because we're

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,130
actually using this
$push operator.

11
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,270
So what we do is we do a query
based on the permalink of the

12
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,830
post we're trying to comment
on and then use $push to

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,740
actually push on the end
of this comments array.

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,980
And then we pass in a callback,
takes an error, and

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,300
the number of documents
or modified.

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,760
So if we have an error, we
actually call back with the

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,320
error and no result.

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,200
If we've succeeded in doing our
update, we just call the

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,590
original callback.

20
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,980
So this is the solution
to Homework 3.3.
