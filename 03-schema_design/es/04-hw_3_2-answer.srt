1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,090

2
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,550
All right, so this is the
solution for homework 3.2.

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,440
You would just do posts.insert
and give

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,210
our post as an argument.

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,160
And then we give it a call back
to call when the post has

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,890
been successfully inserted.

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,720
So if we have an error,
we return an

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,290
error in our call back.

9
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,340
Otherwise, we'd log that we've
entered a new post and call

10
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,120
back with a permalink,
actually.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,230
We don't actually call back with
the result of the insert.

12
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,480
So this is the solution
for homework 3.2.
