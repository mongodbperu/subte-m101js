1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,170

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,870
So the goal of this homework
is to allow us

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,780
to comment on posts.

4
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,000
So we already have these
posts, and we

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,890
want to add a comment.

6
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,720
So let's try to do that.

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,800
So here on the second post--
it says "Next post"--

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,034
we have our name, we have our
email, and let's add a comment

9
00:00:16,034 --> 00:00:17,010
of "foo."

10
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,900
We try to submit this, we get
an error, addComment not yet

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,720
implemented.

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,020
So the assignment for homework
3.3 is to allow users to

13
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,110
comment on blog posts.

14
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,310
So if we go back to where we run
our app, we see the stack

15
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,549
trace from our error handler.

16
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,160
So similar to the way you found
homework 3.2, you could

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,510
do a similar search for
homework 3.3 to do.

18
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,770
We see it's in the same file.

19
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,840
It's also in posts.js.

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,770
So that's actually the place
that has the code for handling

21
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,810
comments in a post.

22
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,440
All right.

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,590
So this is the function
you need to fill out

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,980
for homework 3.3.

25
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,480
So this is the addComment
function.

26
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,470
Here we get a permalink, name,
email, body, and a callback.

27
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,125
So this code here makes our
comment, fills in the email of

28
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:05,300
the comment, and your job is to
actually implement adding

29
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,410
the callback to a post.

30
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,910
Now, if you remember from the
schema of the blog, the

31
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,090
comments are actually in an
array inside of a post.

32
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,180
So you're going to actually have
to figure out how to add

33
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,420
a comment to a single post.

34
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,660
And the permalink is actually
what describes which post

35
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,850
you're trying to add
this comment to.

36
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,460
So that's the assignment
for homework 3.3.
