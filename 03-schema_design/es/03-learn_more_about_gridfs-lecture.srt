00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,370

2
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,940
If you want to learn more about
GridFS a good place to

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,730
start is api.mongodb.org.

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,480
If you go there and you click
on the Java driver and you

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,320
click on the most recent driver
right there, you can

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,490
see that the specification
for GridFS, the

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,309
API, is right there.

8
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,570
And you can see the three
different classes that I used

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,300
to work with GridFS, right,
which is this GridFS object

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,120
right here, this GridFS db
file which is used for

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,020
retrieving objects, and this
GridFS input file which is

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,549
used for writing GridFS files
into the database and taking

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,400
an output stream from a disk.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,790
And then I didn't actually use
this GridFS file, which is

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,980
abstract class or the CLI.

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,390
You can go through these
and you can see a

17
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,890
lot of the same methods.

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,530
So this is a good place to look
if you're looking for

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,780
more information.

20
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,260
