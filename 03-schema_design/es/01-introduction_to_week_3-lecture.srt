00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,880
This week we're going to
go over schema design.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,910
Now, I've told you that MongoDB
has dynamic schema,

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,431
and each document can
have its own schema.

5
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:11,720
And that makes it a little bit
tough to decide what schema

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,490
each document should have.

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,430
In most applications, every
document has the same schema,

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,160
but there are still
choices they made.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,340
You can embed data in a
document, or you could put it

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,990
into its own collection.

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,720
And these decisions will have
an impact on performance and

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,240
ease of programming.

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,800
So through a series of use cases
we're going to take you

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,220
through MongoDB schema design.

15
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,470
Let's get started.
