1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,160

2
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,600
All right.

3
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,110
So, this is the homework
1-1 answer video.

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,300
So, your assignment for this
homework was to, using the

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,270
Mongo shell go into the m101
database and figure out what's

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,300
in the homework 1_1
collection.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,130
So, the first thing
you need to do is

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,820
start the Mongo shell.

9
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,290
And we actually don't need to
give it any arguments at this

10
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,340
point, because we've started the
server on the default port

11
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,990
on local host, which is the
default that the Mongo shell

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,490
tries to connect to.

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,540
So, we run the shell and we can
see MongoDB shell version

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,930
2.4.3 connecting to test.

15
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,590
So, we're now connected to the
test database, and we really

16
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,770
want to be connected to
the m101 database.

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,120
So, the first thing we do is,
we type use m101, and we see

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,620
switch to db m101.

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,250
And the next thing we can
do is type show tables.

20
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,790
So, now we see all the
collections in this database.

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,840
Homework 1_1, homework 1_2,
homework 1_3, and

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,590
system.indexes.

23
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,310
So, the assignment for this part
was to see what's in the

24
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,440
homework 1_1 collection.

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,540
So, we can do that by doing a
find against this collection.

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,060
Here we have db.hw1_1.find,
and this will do a query

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,750
against our collection.

28
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,660
And if we run that, we can see
that we get one document back.

29
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,380
It had an ID, and it has an
answer field which says, hello

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,600
from MongoDB.

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,170
So, that's the answer
to homework 1-1/

32
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:29,210
