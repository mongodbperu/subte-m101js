1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,770
All right, so this is an
introduction to NPM.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,060
NPM is the package manager
for node.js.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,780
So we're going to talk a little
bit about packages, how

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,120
to use them, and how
to install them.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,430
If you look in this directory,
we have two files-- we have

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,400
our app and we have this file
called package.json.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,320
So let's just get started and
let's just run our app.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,670
All right.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,730
So we have a problem--

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,210
cannot find module express.

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,820
So let's look at our app
and try to figure out

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,560
what's going on.

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,900
So we have these require
statements.

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,130
These require statements are
actually how we include

15
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,030
external libraries in a
node.js application.

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,950
So here we're actually requiring
express, requiring

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,980
consolidate, and requiring
MongoDB.

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,260
So we actually depend on
all of these libraries.

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,780
So even though our application
doesn't do anything, we're

20
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,040
depending on all these libraries
for this example.

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,690
So the first thing we can do to
solve this problem is use

22
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,120
NPM install express.

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,680
So we saw that the error message
was "cannot find

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,980
module express", so let's
just install that

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,540
and see if it works.

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,720
All right, so we just
installed express.

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,830
Now, let's try to run
our application.

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,620
So we have another issue--

29
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,190
"cannot find module
consolidate." So if we go back

30
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,520
to our app, see, we don't just
include express, we require

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,170
consolidate and MongoDB.

32
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,510
So we could actually install
each of those individually, or

33
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,270
we could use our package.json
file.

34
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,120
So a lot of node.js applications
come with

35
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,025
package.json file, which
basically has some metadata

36
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:40,750
about the package, including
its dependencies.

37
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,890
So if we look in here, we can
see the name-- intro_to_npm--

38
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,710
we can see the version, and we
can see the description of the

39
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,540
package, and the entry point of
our application, and a list

40
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,880
of dependencies with
their versions.

41
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,400
So let's see what we can
do with this file.

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,010
So NPM actually knows about
this package.json file.

43
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,880
Se of we just type npm install,
NPM will actually

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,690
install automatically.

45
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,639
The packages in the
package.json file.

46
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,400
So now, if we try to run our
application, it runs

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,770
successfully.

48
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,100
One more thing that I want to
note about NPM is that it

49
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,060
installs local modules in the
node modules directory.

50
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,040
So you'll have to install the
dependencies locally for all

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,490
of our examples and stencil code
that we provide, even if

52
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,950
we don't show that step
in every video.

53
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,780
You could actually install them
globally, but for now,

54
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,970
we'll just cover installing
them in the node modules

55
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,520
directory for each application
that you write.

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,200
So we could take a look, just
to verify, that we've

57
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,380
installed the modules
that we expect.

58
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,040
We can see consolidate,
express and MongoDB.

59
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,720
So that's a basic introduction
to the

60
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,620
node.js package manager.

61
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,920
And that should be all you need
to complete this course.

62
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,170
