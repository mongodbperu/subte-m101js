1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,210
All right, so let's talk about
the system requirements for

3
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,250
this course.

4
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,540
So first there's the
operating system.

5
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,660
So we'll make sure everything in
the course works on Mac OSX

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,570
and Windows 7.

7
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,160
So you can also run it on Linux,
and everything should

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,010
work there as well.

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,950
And let us know, actually, if
you're running this on Linux

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,270
and run into issues, and we'll
help you get through them.

11
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,480
Now, as far as Node.js, you
should be fine just using the

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,520
latest version of Node.js, and
actually, if you look on their

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,040
page, you can see the
system requirements

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,780
for installing Node.js.

15
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,190
So let's take a quick
look at that.

16
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,050
So here we're on the Node.js
site, and what you can do is

17
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,810
you can click on Downloads.

18
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,340
And here we can actually
see all the

19
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,600
different options available.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,915
So all of these should work.

21
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:47,830
Just find your system here and
download the right installer.

22
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,080
