1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,500
All right.

3
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,690
So this is the answer video
for homework 1-2.

4
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,080
So the assignment for this was
to run our first application.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,920
So we look in here, and we see
we have application app.js.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,470
And you remember that we try to
run it, and we cannot find

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,460
module mongodb so the solution
to that was to install the

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,730
mongodb module.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,990
All right, so once we have our
module installed, we can run

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,340
our application.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,430
We see answer is
I like kittens.

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,260
So that's the answer
to homework 1-2.

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,510
