00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,120

2
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to M101JS, MongoDB
for Node.js developers.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,210
My name is Andrew Erlichson,
and I'll be teaching this

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,380
course along with Shaun Verch
and Richard Kreuter.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,950
I'm going to be teaching the
more general MongoDB parts,

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,510
and Shaun is to be teaching the
Node.js parts, and Richard

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,570
mostly shows up in the second
week, where he goes through

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,680
all the ins and outs of
the MongoDB shell

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,480
and the query language.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,460
I'm VP of education here at
10gen, Shaun is a software

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,480
engineer, and Richard Kreuter
is a consulting engineer.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,530
So, let's go through the
logistics for the course.

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,780
All right, this is going to be
a seven week online course,

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,950
and it is made up of several
different parts.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,010
One part is the video lectures,
much like you are

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,590
watching right now.

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,230
And then at the end of
many of the video

18
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,200
lecture, there are quizzes.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,850
And these video lectures are
short segments, typically

20
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,190
three to five minutes long,
and the quizzes are little

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,990
learning checks at the very
end of each video lecture.

22
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,260
Not everyone has one,
but many do.

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,710
At the end of each week,
you're going to have a

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,000
homework assignment, and then at
the end, there is going to

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,850
be a final exam.

26
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,820
Now, the video lectures,
in terms of your

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,830
grade, they do not count.

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,370
So they count for 0%
of your grade.

29
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,100
You can watch them or not, but
we recommend it, because

30
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,090
that's really the meat
of the class.

31
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,860
The quizzes count for 0%.

32
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,780
They're meant as little learning
checks to make sure

33
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,870
that you understand it,
as I said earlier.

34
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,580
And the homeworks count for
50% of your grade, and the

35
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,290
final exam counts for
50% of your grade.

36
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,240
Now, we're going to drop
the lowest homework.

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,450
And by drop lowest homework,
we mean that at the end of

38
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,200
each week there's homework, and
then for the week where

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,660
you get the lowest overall score
in the homework, we'll

40
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,740
drop that week.

41
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,960
If you have a perfect
square, we'll drop

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,540
some arbitrary week.

43
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,330
At the very end of the course
there's a final exam, and then

44
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,350
overall, if you get 65% or
better, then you will get a

45
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,970
certificate of completion.

46
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,210
And the certificate of
completion will look a little

47
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,580
bit better than this,
obviously.

48
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,430
It's going to be delivered to
you in PDF form, typically

49
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,170
within a couple weeks of
finishing the class.

50
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,270
It will have your name and the
version of MongoDB that you

51
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,620
used with the course.

52
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,020
And it will be signed
by probably myself

53
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,280
and somebody else.

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,220
And so if you complete the
course with 65% or better,

55
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,990
you'll get a certificate
of completion

56
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,710
from us for the course.

57
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,580
So, all right, it is now time
for our first quiz.

58
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,250
What counts toward your final
grade in this class?

59
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,900
Quizzes, homeworks, final exam,
or class participation?

60
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,150
Check all that apply.

61
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,930
