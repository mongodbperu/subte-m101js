1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
All right, so this is the
answer to the quiz.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,430
So all of these are actually
valid JSON documents because

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,850
you can actually have
nested arrays.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,100
You can have nested objects.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,510
Your objects can be empty.

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,980
And you can have objects
nested in

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,160
arrays arbitrarily deep.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,930
So all of these are valid
JSON documents.

9
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,180
