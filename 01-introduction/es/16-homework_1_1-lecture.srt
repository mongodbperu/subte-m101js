1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,230

2
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,560
So, we have three homework
assignments for week one.

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,340
The first one is just to run
the Mongo Restore command.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,810
This is just to get some data
into MongoDB, so that we can

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,770
actually play around
with it and do some

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,860
interesting things with it.

7
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,350
So this is just basic, getting
started, run the

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,860
Mongo Restore command.

9
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,150
We have a dump provided that we
generated using Mongo Dump

10
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,730
earlier, and that's provided
as part of the course file.

11
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,770
So let's get started and talk
about homework 1-1-.

12
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,940
So, first thing you'll want to
do is go on the course website

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,300
and download the files
for the homework.

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,010
This will be in a zip file, so
I'll just show you how to

15
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,070
extract those on a Mac, and
these command should be the

16
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,790
same on Linux.

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,460
So, just say tar xvzf,
hm1-1.tar.

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,620
So now we extracted homework
1-1, and here we just have a

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,810
single directory dump.

20
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,950
So at this stage, you want to
make sure that you actually

21
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,470
have MongoDB running
on your system.

22
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,720
So if you've actually installed
MongoDB and have the

23
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,220
permissions set up correctly,
you should be able to just

24
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,562
type mongod dash dash dbpath
slash data slash db.

25
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:06,410
And now we have our
server running.

26
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,210
It's waiting for connections
on the default

27
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,490
port on local host.

28
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,920
So, once we've made sure that
mongod is actually running and

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,334
waiting for connections, we
can type mongo restore.

30
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:19,600
dump.

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,940
So what Mongo Restore does is
it descends into the dump

32
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,420
directory, looking for files
to import, connects to

33
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,920
MongoDB, and imports
these files.

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,420
So, notice that our directory
had a single database, n101,

35
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,110
with three different
collections.

36
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,310
Homework 1-1, homework 1-2,
and homework 1-3.

37
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,960
So, that's how you run Mongo
Restore, and your assignment

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,860
for homework 1-1 is to actually
use the Mongo shell,

39
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,390
and figure out what's in the
homework 1-1 collection.

40
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,640
