1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,800
All right, so let's talk about
how to install Node.js on Mac

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,510
OS X. So, the first thing we
want to do is we want to open

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,400
our browser, and enter
nodejs.org.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,900
So this will bring us to the
node.js site, and at this

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,700
point, all we have to do is
click Install, and it will try

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,390
to download the installer
for Node.js.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,540
Here we say keep, and after it's
done downloading, we can

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,840
open it, and it brings
us straight

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,270
into the Node.js installer.

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,370
So here we just click
Continue, Continue.

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,370
Agree with the license
agreement, and click Install.

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,930
So, this requires the
administrator password to

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,395
install software, so
let's do that.

15
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:40,735
Click Install.

16
00:00:40,735 --> 00:00:44,190
And we see that node was
successfully installed.

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,290
So here we have the two
binaries for our node

18
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,980
installation, and we have
to make sure that

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,690
this is in our path.

20
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,120
So the way you can check that
and verify that Node.js is

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,640
actually installed is just go
to a terminal and type node.

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,040
So at this point, it'll bring
us into the Node.js

23
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,360
interactive prompt, and
we can just say

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,720
console.log Hello, World.

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,880
So that's how you install
Node.js on Mac OS X.
