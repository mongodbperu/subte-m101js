1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,280

2
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,560
All right.

3
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,460
So if you remember, homework
1-3 was to run our

4
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,880
application, which is
Hello World using

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,200
Node.js Express and Swig.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,850
So if we look in our folder, we
see we have app.js, we have

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,420
package.json, and
we have views.

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,860
So we have package.json here
because our file has multiple

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,330
dependencies, and this just
describes the dependencies of

10
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,540
our project.

11
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,920
So we can actually just type
npm install, and it will

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,150
actually read the package.json
file and install the

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,540
dependencies.

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,265
So now we can just
run node app.js.

15
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:38,920
We can see express server
started on port 8080.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,020
So if we go to a browser and try
to connect to local post

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,580
8080, we see Hello, Agent 007.

18
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,855
So this is the answer
for homework 1-3.

19
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:49,105
