1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,270

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,570
Alright, so your task was to
match the name Steve in the

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,630
name field of the nested
students array.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,260
So the way we do this is we
select for students.name, and

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,180
look for the value of Steve.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,340
So what this will do is it
will look in the students

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,130
array, it'll look in a nested
object, and it'll look in the

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,760
name field of that object and
then compare it to Steve.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,790
So that's why it will match
this document here.

00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,040
