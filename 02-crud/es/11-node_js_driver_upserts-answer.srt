1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,415

2
00:00:00,415 --> 00:00:00,830
All right.

3
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,980
The answer is that this line of
code will upsert to insert

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,930
or replace the document.

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,680
So the reason for this is that
the save function actually

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,250
checks for the _id.

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,590
And if an _id is
found, it calls

8
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,220
upsert rather than insert.

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,450
So this is a more of a question
about the behavior of

10
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,420
save than upserts in general.

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,670
