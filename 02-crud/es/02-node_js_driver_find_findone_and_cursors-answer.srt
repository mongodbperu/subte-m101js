1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,170

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,310
All right, so the answer is, we
call db.collection grades

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,960
to get our collection.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,860
And on that collection object,
we call .findOne, passing in

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,630
the query and the callback.

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,630
And this will cause the query to
be run against MongoDB and

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,710
the callback to be called with
a single document in the

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,960
result set for that query.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,210
