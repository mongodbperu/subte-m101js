1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
All right, so here's the
answer to the quiz.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,210
So the answer is that
it returns an error.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,150
So the reason is, you can't
actually mix these dollar sign

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,030
operators with normal fields.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,120
And the reason for that is
that MongoDB doesn't know

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,180
whether to do an in place
update, as implied by the

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,100
dollar sign operator, or to
actually replace the document,

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,910
as implied by the normal
field here.

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,160
