1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,780
All right, so this is the answer
to the quiz about skip

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,800
limit and sort.

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,250
So we can include skip limit
and sort options in the

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,180
options object for
find and findOne.

6
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,650
We can pass a sort order as an
argument to find and modify.

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,480
We can call the skip limit and
sort functions on a cursor

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,560
before retrieving
any documents.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,210
But we cannot call the skip
limit and sort functions on a

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,560
cursor after retrieving
some documents.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,930
Now, the reason for this is
that, once we've already

12
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,450
started our query,
we've already

13
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,890
retrieved some documents.

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,390
And we've already made a
commitment to the original

15
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,150
skip limit and sort.

16
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,690
So consider an example where you
returned a few documents,

17
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,370
and then you called sort.

18
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,800
It would be kind of a problem
because the first few

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,830
documents you got back may or
may not have been sorted, and

20
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,900
you're asking MongoDB to sort
the rest of the results set,

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,690
which is not actually supported
and, really, isn't

22
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,150
usually what you would want.

23
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,400
And the same issue applies
to skip and limit.

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,190
We may return some documents
that we should have skipped,

25
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,440
or we may have returned more
documents than the limit by

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,620
the time that we actually tried
to set these parameters

27
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,640
on the cursor after retrieving
the documents.

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,890
