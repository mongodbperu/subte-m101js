1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,340
All right, so this is the
answer to the quiz about

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,700
findAndModify in the
Node js Driver.

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,380
So this line here is the
answer to our quiz.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,930
So first we have an empty
query selector--

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,430
this means we're matching
all documents.

7
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,120
The reason we have to do this is
that we don't actually know

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,370
which grade is the lowest, so we
can't actually make a query

9
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,020
that eliminates any
of our documents.

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,220
Next, we have a sort on grade
increasing, so this is what

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,920
allows us to actually match
the correct document.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,480
It means that we're matching
all documents.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,230
But the first document we get
back will be the lowest,

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,170
because we're sorting
on grade increasing.

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,700
Next, we have this dollar sign
set operator just like in the

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,060
update, where we set
dropped to true.

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,390
Finally, we pass an options
object with new set to true to

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,530
tell findAndModify to call the
callback with the resulting

19
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,740
document rather than with
the old document.

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,990
