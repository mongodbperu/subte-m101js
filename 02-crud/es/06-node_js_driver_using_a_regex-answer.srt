1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,780
All right, so this is the
answer to the quiz

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,040
about using a $regex.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,050
And it actually turns out that
this is the only query

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,020
specifier that would actually
match a document with

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,380
Microsoft anywhere
in the title.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,590
And the reason this matches is
because, by default, $regex is

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,520
just saying, look for this
pattern anywhere in the string

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,280
that we're matching against.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,400
So this one doesn't match
because we're using a $regex

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,590
at the top level.

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,250
We're not actually querying
against the title field.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,140
And this is actually an invalid
query because we're

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,390
trying to use $regex at the
top level and not actually

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,640
using it as a specifier for
any particular field.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,970
Down here, the reason this
doesn't match is because we

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,505
have this carrot at the front.

17
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:46,500
And what that means is that
this is anchored at the

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,320
beginning of the string, so this
would only match titles

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,960
that have Microsoft
at the beginning.

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,260
And this one doesn't match
because we're not actually

21
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,110
using $regex.

22
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,450
We're just matching
against Microsoft.

23
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,670
So this would only match
documents that have a title

24
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,110
that exactly matches
Microsoft.

25
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,619
All right, so that's the
answer to the quiz.

26
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:05,869
