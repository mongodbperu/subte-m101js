1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,240
And the answer is this line
here, because we're passing an

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,720
empty query selector and
actually passing in the

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,250
projection selector correctly
as the second argument.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,880
And we're also making sure to
explicitly turn off the

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,730
underscore ID field.

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,200
These won't work, because the
protection operator is in the

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,580
wrong place.

9
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,220
And this one will not work
because we're not actually

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,790
explicitly removing the
underscore ID field, which is

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,660
included by default even
if we say grade 1 here.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,910
