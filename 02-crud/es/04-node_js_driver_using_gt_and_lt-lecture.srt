1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,010
All right, so this is our first
query operators using

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,660
the Node.js driver.

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,270
So we're going to talk
about using less

5
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,310
than or greater than.

6
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,180
So, let's look at an example.

7
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,670
All right, so just like before
we connect to MongoDB using

8
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,080
the connection string.

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,190
We have our callback here,
gets a [? connect to ?]

10
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,195
database.

11
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:21,120
And we have our query, we have
our find, here we're doing

12
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,500
.each over all the documents,
and logging the documents to

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,380
the console.

14
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,320
So the thing that we're going
to focus on here is this.

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,960
So dollar sign is actually
reserved character in MongoDB,

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,590
and it tells MongoDB, hey,
this is a query operator,

17
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,070
among other things.

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,370
So if you do dollar sign,
greater than, you're saying,

19
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,880
OK, this is a query operator.

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,130
It means I'm looking
for anything

21
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,020
greater than this value.

22
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,360
So here we have "grade." So
before we were looking for all

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,500
the students that had
grade of 100.

24
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,530
But what if you wanted to look
for all the grades in a range,

25
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,060
or some other function
of the grade.

26
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,100
So, that's what the greater
than, less than operators

27
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,330
allow us to do.

28
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,770
So, here we have our grade,
and instead of a value, we

29
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,320
actually gave it an object.

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,700
And in this object we have the
greater than or less than

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,330
operators, so the object
is actually

32
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,650
sort of a query specifier.

33
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,690
We have special requirements
for this query, and the

34
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,800
requirement is that we're
looking for anything greater

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,890
than 80 and less than 95.

36
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,230
And just to add a little more
in here, we also have

37
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,820
'student' 'Joe,' just to show
that we can specify more than

38
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,840
one field in our query.

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,400
Here we just say, 'student' has
to exactly match 'Joe,'

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,450
and 'grade' can actually
be a range.

41
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,580
So you can have really any
combination of exact matches

42
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,230
and query operators when you're
doing your query.

43
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,140
We could actually in here say
'assignment' as well.

44
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,440
So, let's take a look
at what we get back.

45
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,230
So let's run our application.

46
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,400
And we see, we get only
documents back that have

47
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,720
'student' of 'Joe,' and we get
all of his assignments that

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,880
had grades between 80 and 95.

49
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,500
So that's an example of using
less than or greater in the

50
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,360
Node.js driver.

51
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,260
So here's a quiz.

52
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,440
This is just to see if you're
paying attention.

53
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,180
This is a quiz about using the
dollar sign greater than, and

54
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,590
dollar sign less
than operators.

55
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,470
So here we just connect, we
check our errors, and then we

56
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,660
do a find with our query and use
each function, iterate the

57
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,020
documents and print them
to the console.

58
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,930
So your job is to actually
define this query object to

59
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,300
get all the documents with the
grade between 69 and 80.

60
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,690
So we want to find all of
the Cs in this class.

61
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,520
So when you figure that out,
come down here and enter it

62
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,770
into the text box.

63
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,470
