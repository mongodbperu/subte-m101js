1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,560
All right.

3
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,730
So now we're going to get to our
course project, "Building

4
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,230
a Blog on Node.js." We'll
have most of the

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,540
blog written for you.

6
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,020
And your job will be to fill in
specific queries to MongoDB

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,900
that update the necessary
collections or read data from

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,680
the collections that we
use to populate the

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,570
pages on the blog.

10
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,270
Right now, I'll just show you
the user interface so you get

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,600
a sense of what the finished
product is going to look like.

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,970
We'll go to a terminal just
to show you to do this.

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,370
If you look in here, we have
our blog project files.

14
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,606
This is our main application.

15
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:36,530
This is the application we're
actually going to run.

16
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,190
And here we have a "routes"
directory.

17
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,240
And this actually has all
our routes for express.

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,100
Down here, we have sessions,
users, and posts.

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,020
These actually correspond
to our three

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,810
collections for the blog.

21
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,710
These contain the code that
you're actually going to be

22
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,190
modifying to complete
this project.

23
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,660
The first thing we want
to do is run our app.

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,610
And you notice, we actually are
looking for a module that

25
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,750
we don't have installed.

26
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,340
If you notice up here, we
actually don't have a node

27
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,760
modules folder.

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,990
But we do have a package.json
folder.

29
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,100
So let's just type
"NPM install" to

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,270
install all of our modules.

31
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,670
All right.

32
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,920
So we installed all
our dependencies.

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,100
Let's just run our
application.

34
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,450
All right.

35
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,820
Express server listening
on port 3,000.

36
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,780
So let's take a look at
what our finished

37
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,110
blog should look like.

38
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,750
Let's go to local host 3,000.

39
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,520
And we're at our blog.

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,900
This is our home page.

41
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,010
There's nothing on
it right now.

42
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,530
Let's actually log in so we
can create a new post.

43
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:40,060
Let's create a username "test,"
password "test." And

44
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,180
we have no such user.

45
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,270
So let's hit the back button
here and actually sign up.

46
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,315
Here's our sign up page.

47
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:52,240
Let's create a username "test"
with a password of "test," and

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,410
verify test with test
example.com as our email.

49
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,050
All right.

50
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,100
So now we're logged in.

51
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,300
We can actually go to
our blog homepage.

52
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,640
It's not very interesting
because it doesn't really have

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,020
any posts on it.

54
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,240
So let's go create a new post.

55
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,080
Let's call it "first." This
is the first post.

56
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,820
Now down here we
have our tags.

57
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,640
And we can say first, comma,
post, comma, blog.

58
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,360
So now let's submit that.

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,600
And we are actually
specifically

60
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,620
at our first post.

61
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,190
And we can go to
the blog home.

62
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,830
This shows all the posts.

63
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,690
We just have one right now.

64
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,140
And notice we actually have
zero comments on the post.

65
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,920
So let's add a comment
to our post--

66
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,410
first comment on first post.

67
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,660
So we submit.

68
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,500
Now our post has a comment.

69
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,780
Let's create another post.

70
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,180
And let's give it some
of the same tags.

71
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,630
Let's give it post, blog
tags, and submit that.

72
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,430
Now we just see second, because
we're specifically on

73
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,890
the page to view the
second post.

74
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,590
So let's go back to our home.

75
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,890
And now we can see we have both
our first, second post.

76
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,720
First post has one comment.

77
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,840
Second post has zero comments.

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,220
And they have some
tags in common.

79
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,520
The next thing we can do is
actually see all posts for a

80
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,350
specific tag.

81
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,210
Right now we just have two, so
it's not terribly interesting.

82
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,200
But basically what this is
showing is all the posts with

83
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,980
the tag "post." Actually if we
click here on "first," we just

84
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,720
see all the post with the
tag "first," which

85
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,500
is just this one.

86
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,120
And finally, we have
a log-out page.

87
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,920
And once we log out, we can
still see our posts.

88
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,570
So this is actually visible to
people not logged in, but we

89
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,960
actually can't create
a new post.

90
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,830
So that's the basic
functionality of our blog.

91
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,270
This is just so you get a sense
of the finished product

92
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,940
would look like when you're
working on your application.

93
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,590
Hopefully that's enough of an
introduction so that you know

94
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,650
what the blog should do
and how it should

95
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,910
work when it's finished.

96
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,160
