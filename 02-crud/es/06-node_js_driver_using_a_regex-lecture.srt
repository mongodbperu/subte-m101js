1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,740
All right, so now that we've
got our new data set, let's

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,760
try to learn a little
bit more about it.

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,810
So for our first example,
we'll actually

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,820
use the $regex operator.

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,290
And what this basically does
is it allows you to build

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,010
queries that are regular
expressions.

8
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,610
So let's get right into that.

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,510
So let's just say in Mongo,
course, to connect to the

10
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,500
course database directly.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,710
And now, when I looked on the
"Our Technology" homepage, I

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,290
saw a lot of posts that
mentioned the NSA.

13
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,800
So let's find all the posts that
have NSA in the title.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,300
So what this query is doing is
we're saying db.reddit.find,

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,190
'title', and instead of an exact
match, we're actually

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,030
using the $regex operator.

17
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,390
So basically this means that
MongoDB's going to treat this

18
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,300
as a regular expression, and
search anywhere in the title

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,650
for the characters 'NSA'.

20
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,210
The title doesn't have to be
this exact string, it just has

21
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,460
to be anywhere in the title.

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,080
So that's going to give us
all the documents that

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,880
have NSA in the title.

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,319
Actually to make this simpler,
let's project out part of it.

25
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,240
So basically here we're going
to project out the ID field

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,380
and only include the
title field to make

27
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,790
this easier to read.

28
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,990
All right, so these are the
posts with NSA in the title.

29
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,930
So that's how to do this
from the Mongo show.

30
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,450
Now let's look into how to
do this from node.js.

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,060
All right, so here's
our example of

32
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,200
using a regex in node.js.

33
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,050
So pretty much everything
is the same as our other

34
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,410
examples, except here we're
using the $regex operator for

35
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:38,730
our title, much like the way
we are using #.

36
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,200
So all we have to do is pass on
this query to find, and we

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,470
get all the documents
that have NSA

38
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,900
anywhere in the title.

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,020
So let's go back here.

40
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,390
And so let's run our app.

41
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,960
All right, so now we run our
application and we can see,

42
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,380
printed out here, titles
of all the posts that

43
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,100
have NSA in the title.

44
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,250
So that's how to use regex in
MongoDB and we could ask

45
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,660
pretty much any question
we want.

46
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,860
We could find all posts with
Microsoft, all posts with

47
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,780
Skype, all posts with
email, and actually

48
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,040
any arbitrary regex.

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,210
All right, so this is your
quiz for using the $regex

50
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,960
query selector.

51
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,220
So the quiz is, which of the
following query expressions

52
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,470
would match a document with
Microsoft anywhere in the

53
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,620
'title' field?

54
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,550
Select all that apply.

55
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,120
So here we have four
query selectors.

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,520
So you would use these in a find
one query, a find query,

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,630
or an update.

58
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,950
And basically these would
specify which documents you

59
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,590
returned from your query.

60
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,040
So your job is to figure out
which of these documents would

61
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,290
actually match a document with
Microsoft anywhere in the

62
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,030
'title' field, meaning that it
would actually be in our

63
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,070
result set.

64
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,830
So you can actually test this by
making some documents with

65
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,720
Microsoft in the 'title' field
and then just putting these

66
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,540
into a find one or find, and
figuring out which ones

67
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,790
actually match.

68
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,460
