1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,070
All right, so we've talked about
finding documents in

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,320
various combinations.

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,040
We've talked about updating
documents.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,450
We've talked about inserting
documents.

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,430
So now let's talk about
deleting documents.

7
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,200
So for that, we have
a small example.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,680
All right, so this is an example
of using remove in

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,180
Node.js driver.

10
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,300
So here we have a query.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,110
We're looking for all documents
that have an

12
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,920
assignment of homework three.

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,610
And all we have to do
is pass that as the

14
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,640
first argument to remove.

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,950
So what this will do is it will
just delete all documents

16
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,190
that match this query.

17
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,470
So maybe homework three
was a bad assignment.

18
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,820
We just want to delete
all those documents.

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,550
And the second argument to
remove is a call back that

20
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,510
takes an error and a number
for how many documents we

21
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,260
actually removed.

22
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,830
So here we logged into the
console, successfully removed,

23
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,940
and then the number of
documents, documents.

24
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,210
All right, so let's run that.

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,920
So we actually get--
successfully

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,050
removed four documents.

27
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,870
So if we run it again,
we see successfully

28
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,890
removed zero documents.

29
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,610
So the first time we ran this,
we matched all documents that

30
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,080
had an assignment of
homework three.

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,230
We removed them so that when we
ran it again, we actually

32
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,680
had no matches and removed
no documents.

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,940
All right, so that's how you
remove documents in MongoDB.

34
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,430
So now you know the complete set
of CRUD operations using

35
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,210
the Node.js MongoDB driver.

36
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,400
All right, so this is the quiz
about using remove in the

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,890
Node.js driver.

38
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,800
So the question is, which of
the following remove calls

39
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,020
would definitely remove all
the documents in the

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,470
collection "foo," regardless
of its contents.

41
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,750
Check all that apply.

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,200
You can assume that call back
is a function defined

43
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,920
elsewhere that we expect
to be called when

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,170
the remove call completes.

45
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,120
