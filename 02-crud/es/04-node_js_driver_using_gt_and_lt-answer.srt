1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,110

2
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,500
All right, so this
is the answer.

3
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,290
We have our query equals
grade greater than 69

4
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,720
and less than 80.

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,570
And the var is important here,
because otherwise query would

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,300
leak into the global
name space.

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,550
