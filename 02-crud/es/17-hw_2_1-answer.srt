1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
All right, so this is the
answer to homework 2-1.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,870
So if you remember, we just
looked at our weather_data.csv

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,230
file, saw that it had
a header line.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:15,630
So when we type "mongoimport,"
we want to pass --type csv

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,110
--headerline.

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,290
And now we actually have to
specify what database and what

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,320
collection that we're
importing our

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,770
weather data into.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,140
Now here we specify the file.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,260
We run this command, connect
to the local host.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,440
And we imported almost 3,000
objects from this

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,250
weather_data CSV file.

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,450
So now if we enter the Mongo
shell and use the weather

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:46,560
database, and we type
db.data.findOne, because

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,720
that's collection we actually
put this in, you can see we

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,840
have our weather document.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,300
So this is part one, so
we've successfully

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,960
imported our data.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,560
So now let's talk
about part two.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,600
So that's the analysis
portion.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,420
So the assignment was to figure
out the state that had

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,330
the lowest temperature recorded
when the wind

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,670
direction was coming from the
West, meaning that the wind

24
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,760
direction was between
180 and 360.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,160
So let's talk that through.

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,410
So we can do db.data.find.

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,840

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,820
And we want our wind direction
to be greater than 180 and

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,410
less than 360.

30
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,250
And then we want to sort
on temperature.

31
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,910
And we want to sort increasing
so that the document we get

32
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,710
back is going to be the
lowest temperature.

33
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,190
And let's limit that to one
for simplicity, and let's

34
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,350
pretty print it.

35
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,850
All right, so this
is our document.

36
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,920
It's New Mexico.

37
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,570
And we have a wind
direction of 260.

38
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,730
That's coming from the West
between 180 and 360.

39
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,210
And we have a temperature
is zero.

40
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,120
So this is the lowest recorded
temperature for that month

41
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,430
when the wind was coming
from the West.

42
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,136
So that's the answer
to homework 2-1.

43
00:02:05,136 --> 00:02:06,432
