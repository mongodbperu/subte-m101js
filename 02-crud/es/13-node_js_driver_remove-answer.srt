1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,050
All right, so this is the answer
to the quiz about using

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,020
remove in the Node.js driver.

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,430
So first of all, this last one
wouldn't be guaranteed to

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,010
remove all the documents because
there may be some

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,850
documents for which the x
field does not exist.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,300
And those documents would not
match this query specifier and

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,590
therefore not be removed.

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,800
This next one would remove all
the documents because we're

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,290
passing an empty query
specifier.

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,080
This one's a little bit
trickier because we're

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,760
actually passing a specifier
for x not in, and then this

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,930
empty array.

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,420
This is a little bit of a subtle
point, but it turns out

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,350
that every document would
match the query selector

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,580
because documents that have an
x field are guaranteed to not

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,690
be in the survey, as well
as documents that do

18
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,880
not have an x field.

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,240
Now, this top one may seem a
little strange because we're

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,840
not actually passing a query
specifier at all.

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,130
That's actually supported
by the driver.

22
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,660
So what the driver actually
does is, it will check the

23
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,110
types of its arguments to figure
out what you actually

24
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,470
passed in and act accordingly.

25
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,050
And in this case, passing just
a call back and no query

26
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,950
selector is the same as passing
a query selector that

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,200
matches every document.

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,130
