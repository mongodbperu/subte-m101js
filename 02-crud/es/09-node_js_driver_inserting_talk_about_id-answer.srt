1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,130

2
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,460
The answer is that both
documents will be inserted

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,660
successfully.

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,340
So if we go back to
the example in the

5
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,180
quiz, we can see why.

6
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,100
So in MongoDB, uniqueness is
case-sensitive, which means

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,180
that even though both of these
strings say George, the fact

8
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,550
this is an uppercase G and this
is a lowercase g means

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,780
that these are actually
different

10
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,350
keys for the _id field.

11
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,290
So the result of calling insert
with an array, which is

12
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,090
valid in the nojs driver, will
be to insert both of these

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,460
documents without returning
a duplicate key error.
