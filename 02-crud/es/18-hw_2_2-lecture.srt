1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,100

2
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,450
All right, so let's talk
about homework 2-2.

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,880
So in the last homework, you
imported a weather data set.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,850
And in this homework, we are
actually going to ask you to

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,190
do a little bit more complicated
analysis on this

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,870
data set using the
Node.js driver.

7
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,670
So let's take a look
at our assignment.

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,060
All right, so your assignment
for this homework is to write

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,090
a program that finds the
document with the highest

10
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,470
recorded temperature for each
state, then add a month high

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,020
field for that document, setting
its value to true.

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,259
Use the weather data set that
you imported in homework 2.1.

13
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,140
And a hint, which I'll go over,
is that if you select

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,930
all the weather documents, and
you sort by state and then by

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,810
temperature, you can iterate the
documents and know that,

16
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,920
when the state changes, you've
reached the highest

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,700
temperature for that state.

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,980
So we have four states that
we have data for.

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,040
And we have a month's worth of
data for each state, which

20
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,380
means that you should end up
setting the month high field

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,100
on four different documents.

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,880
All right, so the way we
recommend you do this homework

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,370
assignment is to construct
a query where you

24
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,230
first sort by state.

25
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,590
And then you sort by
temperature, decreasing.

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,440
So what that gives us is a sort
order such that when we

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,790
change states, we know that that
document has the highest

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,530
temperature for that state
because within a state the

29
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,470
temperature is sort
of decreasing.

30
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,620
So basically, here, we started
iterating our results set.

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,910
And we know that this document
is going to have the highest

32
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,780
temperature because we sort it
by temperature decreasing

33
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,030
within this state.

34
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,460
As we iterate further, we get
down, and we see that we've

35
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,640
transitioned to state two, which
means we know that this

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,690
document now has the highest
temperature for this state.

37
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,220
So that's how we recommend you
complete homework 2-2.

38
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,470
