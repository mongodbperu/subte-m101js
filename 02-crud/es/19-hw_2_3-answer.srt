1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,530
All right.

3
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,610
So here's the answer to the
homework assignment.

4
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,340
This is the answer
to homework 2-3.

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,850
So just to recap, your
assignment was to fill in the

6
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,490
user's data access objects
so that sign-up and

7
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,960
login work in our blog.

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,930
So let's take a look at
the finished code.

9
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,230
All right.

10
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,005
So the first function we
had to implement was

11
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,540
the add user function.

12
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,650
This is actually called from
the sign-up formula blog.

13
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,960
So we get a user name, password
and email from the

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,580
user that wants to sign up.

15
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,800
So if we look down here, we can
see our to-do for homework

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,760
2-3 and the finished result.

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,290
So your job was to insert the
user document into the

18
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,800
collection, effectively adding
the new user because all our

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,030
other validation functions
depend on this user document

20
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,050
and check the result.

21
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,990
If there is no error, you
just can log that you've

22
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,370
inserted a new user.

23
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,090
You call back with null and the
result's actually an array

24
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,420
of documents that
we've inserted.

25
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,550
So we call back here
with result zero.

26
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,140
And if there was an error, we'd
call back the error and a

27
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,270
null result.

28
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,030
All right.

29
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,280
So the next function
was validate login.

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,130
So this is the one
with this giant

31
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,200
validate user dock function.

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,050
But if we go down here, you can
see that the code that you

33
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,500
actually need to implement
this is just one line.

34
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,140
So we just do users.findOne, the
ID of user name and just

35
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,780
pass it the validate
user dock function.

36
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,220
So this will handle all the
validation for us and call our

37
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,430
original call back that was
passed in to this overall

38
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,580
function with whatever error
occurred or the user document,

39
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,790
if we found it.

40
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,165
So that's the answer
to homework 2-3.

41
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:41,415
