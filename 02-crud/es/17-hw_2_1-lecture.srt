1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,150

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,350
So now let's talk about
homework 2-1.

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,470
So let's take a look at what's
in this directory.

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,600
So we have a homework
question here.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,000
But when you extract, you'll
see this file called

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,240
weather_data.csv.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,140
And your assignment will be to
import and analyze this file.

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,050
Let's actually take a
look at this file.

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,480
So notice here that at
the top, we have

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,290
all of these headers.

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,570
And then down here,
we have our data.

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,210
So this is actually important
and something you want to pay

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,490
attention to when you're
using mongoimport.

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,330
So if we look at mongoimport,
you can see there's this

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,900
option, --headerline.

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,590
And basically it says that
the first line in

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,180
input file is a header.

18
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,580
So this is nice, because it'll
make sure that we've set all

19
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,020
our fields correctly and put the
values in with the correct

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,240
field names.

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,180
So just to repeat that, you want
to add --headerline when

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,180
you import the CSV file
using mongoimport.

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,910
And you also want to
use --type.csv.

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,140
So to take a look at our
homework question, part one is

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,290
to import weather_data.csv
using mongoimport.

26
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,980
And then part two we ask you
a data analysis question.

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,340
So this is just some background,
so you kind of

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,090
know what the data is
you're dealing with.

29
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,440
But the thing to focus on is
that your assignment is to

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,930
figure out the state that
recorded the lowest

31
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,140
temperature when the wind was
coming from the west.

32
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,690
So what that means is the
wind direction field is

33
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,330
between 180 and 360.

34
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,980
So just restate this, you want
to find the state that had the

35
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,360
lowest recorded temperature in
a document that had the wind

36
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,580
direction field between
180 and 360.

37
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,846
So that's homework 2-1.

38
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:51,096
